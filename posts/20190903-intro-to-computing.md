Execute the program yourself and document the result. Ask three different people to execute it as well and document their result. Compare the results and make notes regarding how they are similar or different. Make a small change to your initial program and rewrite it. This time, be specific about your goals and note down how you would like the results to differ. Repeat the first steps using the new program and document the results.*
